# GAN-on-tf-dataset-flowers
# **Implement a simple GAN on flowers dataset**  
Implement architecture that is introduced in [Matlab website](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/train-generative-adversarial-network.html)
#**Architecture**
this architecture includes two main parts: 1-generator 2-discriminator and you can see them in the following:
