# GAN-on-tf-dataset-flowers
# **Implement a simple GAN on flowers dataset**  
Implement a DCGAN that is introduced in [Matlab website](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/train-generative-adversarial-network.html) this model trained on tensorflow flower dataset and 
#**Architecture**
This architecture includes two main parts: 1- generator 2- discriminator and you can see them in the following:
